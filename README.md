### Compliance Test Project


This repository mocks [Opencontrols/freedonia-compliance](https://github.com/opencontrol)

The reason for creating a new repository that mocks the freedonia effort, is to customize a few things.

1) The documentation output (appending the control gaps to the documentation)

2) The standard controls (instead of NIST/FRIST - customize a standard)

3) The audit policy (instead of the AU Poicy - customize a low-risk policy)

4) Use a single repository instead of linked repositories (and format the YAML appropriately)
